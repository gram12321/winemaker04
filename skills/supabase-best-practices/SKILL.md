  abstract: Comprehensive Postgres performance optimization guide for developers using Supabase and Postgres. Contains performance rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact from critical (query performance, connection management) to incremental (advanced features). Each rule includes detailed explanations, incorrect vs. correct SQL examples, query plan analysis, and specific performance metrics to guide automated optimization and code generation.

# Supabase Postgres Best Practices

Use this skill when the task is database-centric in winemaker04.

Default repo router: `../winemaker-game/SKILL.md`

## Winemaker Database Boundaries

- Keep app-level DB reads and writes in `src/lib/database/`.
- Keep business calculations in `src/lib/services/`.
- For schema changes, create/update SQL migration files under `migrations/`.
- Avoid direct database access from page or UI component code.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing or reviewing SQL queries
- Designing or changing schema
- Implementing indexes and query-performance improvements
- Reviewing RLS and access patterns
- Diagnosing Postgres performance bottlenecks

## Priority Focus For This Repo

1. Query correctness and indexing
2. Company-scoped data isolation
3. RLS safety and least-privilege behavior
4. Migration safety and reversibility
5. Measured optimization using explain plans

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Query Performance | CRITICAL | `query-` |
| 2 | Connection Management | CRITICAL | `conn-` |
| 3 | Security & RLS | CRITICAL | `security-` |
| 4 | Schema Design | HIGH | `schema-` |
| 5 | Concurrency & Locking | MEDIUM-HIGH | `lock-` |
| 6 | Data Access Patterns | MEDIUM | `data-` |
| 7 | Monitoring & Diagnostics | LOW-MEDIUM | `monitor-` |
| 8 | Advanced Features | LOW | `advanced-` |

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and SQL examples:

```
references/query-missing-indexes.md
references/schema-partial-indexes.md
references/_sections.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect SQL example with explanation
- Correct SQL example with explanation
- Optional EXPLAIN output or metrics
- Additional context and references
- Supabase-specific notes (when applicable)

## Practical Sequence

1. Confirm where the query is called from in `src/lib/database/`.
2. Validate company scoping and filters first.
3. Check indexes and query plan.
4. Implement minimal safe SQL change.
5. Add migration when schema/index changes are needed.
6. Re-run targeted tests and check for regressions.
