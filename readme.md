# Winery Management Game ‚Äì Architecture & Code Generation Guide

This briefing is for AI-assisted code generation for the **Winery Management Game**, a turn-based single-player simulation game.

---

## üîß Project Overview
Players manage a winery, including vineyard operations, wine production, building upgrades, staff, and sales. The game includes a simple economic engine with **formula-based wine prices** and **NPC buyers** ‚Äî there is **no multiplayer or player-to-player interaction**.

### üíª Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + supabase
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, SHADCN (Maybe bootstrap if nessesacy) (no custom CSS in this iteration).


### üß† State & Logic

- **Game State**: Time/season and financial data centralized in `gameState.ts`
- **Database**: Vineyards and inventory stored in separate Supabase tables for scalability
- **Game Logic**: All business logic (production, quality calculations, finances) in service files, not components

#### React Hooks for State Management
- **`useGameInit()`**: Initializes game state on app startup, handles loading/error states
- **`useGameUpdates()`**: Global subscription system for reactive UI updates across components
- **`useGameStateWithData<T>()`**: Enhanced hook for loading async data with automatic updates via global subscription system (replaces useAsyncData)
- **`usePrestigeUpdates()`**: Event-driven hook that monitors prestige changes and updates customer relationships for active customers only
- **`useLoadingState()`**: Simplified loading state hook with withLoading wrapper for async operations
- **`useTableSortWithAccessors()`**: Hook for table sorting functionality with type-safe accessors

#### Barrel Export/Import System
- **Centralized Imports**: All components, hooks, services, and utilities use barrel exports for cleaner imports
- **`@/components/ui`**: Single import for all ShadCN UI components
- **`@/hooks`**: Single import for all custom hooks
- **`@/lib/services`**: Single import for all service functions
- **`@/lib/utils`**: Single import for all utility functions
- **Shared Interfaces**: `@/components/UItypes` provides consistent prop types across components

### üîå Supabase Backend (MCP Server Tools)

- **MCP Configuration**: Supabase MCP server configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Access Levels**: Both anon and service role keys available for different operations
- **Management API**: Personal Access Token (PAT) required for database management operations
- **Environment**: All Supabase credentials managed through MCP server configuration

### üìà Economic System
- The economy is **formula-based**, not dynamic or real-time.
- Wine prices, land values, and prestige scores are **calculated**, not simulated.
- Sales are resolved to randomized NPCs (non-interactive).
- **Mathematical Functions**: Centralized in `src/lib/utils/calculator.ts` with sophisticated multi-segment scaling algorithms

### üèóÔ∏è Database Architecture (v0.6)
**Multi-Company Database Design:**
- **`companies`**: Company records with financial data, prestige, and game state
- **`users`**: User profiles with authentication and preferences
- **`vineyards`**: Individual vineyard records with company_id for data isolation
- **`wine_batches`**: Wine production pipeline with stage/process tracking
- **`wine_orders`**: Customer orders with relationship tracking and calculation data
- **`customers`**: Global customer database with regional characteristics and relationship management
- **`company_customers`**: Junction table for active customer tracking and performance optimization
- **`relationship_boosts`**: Customer relationship boost events with decay tracking
- **`transactions`**: Financial transaction history with categorization
- **`highscores`**: Global leaderboard system with company value rankings
- **`achievements`**: Achievement system with progress tracking
- **Performance**: Indexed queries, company-specific data isolation, optimized customer loading

**Reactive State Pattern:**
- Services update database ‚Üí trigger global updates ‚Üí components auto-refresh
- No manual refresh needed, fully reactive UI
- Optimistic updates with error handling
