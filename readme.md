# Winery Management Game ‚Äì AI Development Guide

**AI Agent Context**: Turn-based winery simulation with formula-based economics, no multiplayer.

## üîß Core Architecture
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Supabase
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI (no custom CSS)
- **Data Flow**: Services ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Global Updates ‚Üí Reactive UI

### üß† Development Patterns

**CRITICAL RULES FOR AI AGENTS:**
- **ALWAYS use barrel exports**: `@/components/ui`, `@/hooks`, `@/lib/services`, `@/lib/utils`, `@/lib/constants`
- **ALWAYS use custom hooks**: `useLoadingState()`, `useGameStateWithData()`, `useGameState()`, `useGameUpdates()`, `usePrestigeUpdates()`, `useWineBalance()`, `useWineBatchBalance()`, `useFormattedBalance()`, `useBalanceQuality()`, `useTableSortWithAccessors()`
- **ALWAYS use shared interfaces**: `PageProps`, `NavigationProps`, `CompanyProps`, `DialogProps`, `FormProps`, `TableProps`, `LoadingProps`, `CardProps`, `BaseComponentProps` from `@/components/UItypes`
- **ALWAYS use service exports**: Game state (`getGameState`, `updateGameState`, `getCurrentCompany`, `getCurrentPrestige`), Finance (`addTransaction`, `loadTransactions`, `calculateFinancialData`), Sales (`fulfillWineOrder`, `rejectWineOrder`, `generateSophisticatedWineOrders`), Vineyard (`createVineyard`, `plantVineyard`, `getAllVineyards`, `purchaseVineyard`), Winery (`crushGrapes`, `startFermentation`, `stopFermentation`, `bottleWine`, `progressFermentation`)
- **ALWAYS use utility exports**: Formatting (`formatNumber`, `formatCurrency`, `formatDate`, `formatGameDate`, `formatPercent`), Calculations (`calculateSkewedMultiplier`, `calculateAsymmetricalMultiplier`, `calculateBaseWinePrice`), Company utils (`getCurrentCompanyId`, `getCompanyQuery`), Wine utilities (`getWineQualityCategory`, `getColorClass`, `getBadgeColorClasses`)
- **Business logic in services**: Never put calculations in components
- **Reactive updates**: Services trigger global updates, components auto-refresh

**‚ö†Ô∏è Mobile Responsiveness:** The codebase includes `useIsMobile()` hook for responsive design. Future components should consider mobile layouts and test across different screen sizes.

**Constants Directory (`@/lib/constants`):** Centralized configuration and data via barrel exports:
- Import from `@/lib/constants` (barrel). It re-exports:
  - `constants.ts` - Game initialization, sales constants, wine quality, customer regional data
  - `vineyardConstants.ts` - Country-region mapping, soil types, altitude ranges, market data
  - `grapeConstants.ts` - Grape metadata and base wine characteristics
  - `namesConstants.ts` - Country-specific name databases for vineyards and customers
  - `activityConstants.ts` - Activity system constants and work calculations
  - `balanceAdjustments.ts` - Wine balance system configuration (dynamic adjustments, synergy rules)

**MCP Integration:**
- Supabase MCP configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Both anon and service role keys available
- PAT required for database management

**Legacy Reference Documentation:**
- `@docs/old_iterations/v1/` - Original JavaScript implementation with complex balance system
- `@docs/old_iterations/v3/` - Previous React/TypeScript iteration with different architecture
- Use for reference when implementing new features or understanding legacy systems

**Local Storage Policy:**
- Only `lastCompanyId` is persisted for autologin. No full company object is stored. All live data (prestige, money, etc.) is fetched from DB/services and updated via hooks.

### üèóÔ∏è Database Schema
**Core Tables:**
- `companies` - Company data, financial state, prestige, game progression
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `vineyards` - Vineyard management (vine age, soil, altitude, aspect, prestige)
- `wine_batches` - Wine production pipeline (grapes ‚Üí must ‚Üí wine ‚Üí bottled)
- `wine_orders` - Customer orders with relationship tracking and pricing
- `wine_log` - Wine production history and completed wines
- `customers` - Global customer database with regional characteristics
- `company_customers` - Company-customer relationship tracking
- `prestige_events` - Comprehensive prestige tracking with decay
- `relationship_boosts` - Customer relationship events and boosts
- `transactions` - Financial history with categorization
- `activities` - Activity system (planting, harvesting, etc.)
- `notifications` - System notifications and alerts
- `highscores` - Leaderboard and achievement tracking
- `achievements` - Achievement system
- `user_settings` - User preferences and configuration

## Core Game Systems & Features

### 1. Wine Production System ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Wine Batch Pipeline**: grapes ‚Üí must ‚Üí wine ‚Üí bottled
- **Process Tracking**: none ‚Üí fermentation ‚Üí aging ‚Üí bottled
- **Winery Actions**: Crushing, Start/Stop Fermentation, Progress Tracking, Bottling
- **Fermentation Progress**: 0-100% with manual progress control
- **Completed Wine Format**: "Grape Variety, Vineyard Name, Vintage" with bottle count
- **Database Integration**: Full CRUD operations with reactive UI updates

**Implemented (Advanced System):**
- Wine characteristics (acidity, aroma, body, spice, sweetness, tannins) with per-characteristic balanced ranges
- Sophisticated balance calculation with cross-trait penalties and synergy rules
- Harvest characteristics system with vineyard condition modifiers (ripeness, quality, altitude, suitability)
