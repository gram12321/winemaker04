Next task is to create a basic implementation. We want to keep this as basic as possible, and do as small steps at a time as possible. So no running off into new ideas or improvements. 

task is:
1. Create a basic layout/UI for the user. And basic pages. Dashboard, Finance, Vineyard, Winery, Sales
2. Establis gamestate, with basic timemanagement btn and connect time to backend. For now we simply want to be able to display current day/season/year and advance it (nothing happens but date advance)
