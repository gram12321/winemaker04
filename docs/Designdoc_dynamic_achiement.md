CORRECT - No Dynamic Achievement System Yet
Looking at Achievements.tsx, you currently have:
What EXISTS:
‚úÖ UI placeholder for achievements page
‚úÖ Static achievement definitions (hardcoded in component)
‚úÖ Progress simulation based on company data (client-side only)
‚úÖ Category filtering and display
‚ùå NO database storage for achievements
‚ùå NO automatic achievement checking
‚ùå NO prestige event spawning
‚ùå NO real unlock tracking
What's MISSING:
Database Table: achievements (to track unlocked state)
Service Layer: achievementService.ts (check conditions, unlock achievements)
Prestige Integration: Spawn prestige events when unlocking
Weekly Tick Integration: Call achievement checker
Achievement Definitions: Move from component to constants (like features)
üìã PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
Since we're planning both Aging System and Generic Achievement System, here's the optimal sequence:


1. Build generic achievement system with prestige spawning
2. Add basic aging achievements (tests the system)
3. Implement bottle aging feature
4. Add more aging achievements (builds on working system)
5. Implement cellar collection prestige

Phase 1: Generic Achievement System (2-3 hours)
Database table + service layer
Achievement checking + unlock logic
Prestige event spawning
Basic achievements (money, years, sales)
Aging achievements (uses Phase 1 system)
Phase 2: Cellar Collection Prestige (1-2 hours)
Implement permanent prestige event
Power function with oxidation filtering
Weekly recalculation
