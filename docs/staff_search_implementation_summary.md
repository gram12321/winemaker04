# Staff Search System Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete!

The complete staff search system from v3 has been successfully migrated to v4. The system now features a two-phase hiring process with full specialization support.

---

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Service Layer (`staffSearchService.ts`)
**Location**: `src/lib/services/user/staffSearchService.ts`

**Key Functions**:
- ‚úÖ `calculateSearchCost()` - Cost calculation based on candidates, skill level, and specializations
- ‚úÖ `calculateSearchWork()` - Work calculation for search activity  
- ‚úÖ `calculateHiringWorkRange()` - Min/max work estimates for hiring
- ‚úÖ `generateStaffCandidates()` - Random candidate generation matching search criteria
- ‚úÖ `startStaffSearch()` - Initiates search activity and deducts cost
- ‚úÖ `completeStaffSearch()` - Generates candidates when search completes
- ‚úÖ `startHiringProcess()` - Creates hiring activity for selected candidate
- ‚úÖ `completeHiringProcess()` - Adds staff to company and deducts first month's wage
- ‚úÖ `clearPendingCandidates()` - Cleanup function

**Storage Solution**: Candidates stored in `gameState.pendingStaffCandidates` (temporary, cleared on new search or modal close)

---

### 2. Activity System Integration
**Location**: `src/lib/services/activity/activitymanagers/activityManager.ts`

**Updated Completion Handlers**:
- ‚úÖ `STAFF_SEARCH` ‚Üí Calls `completeStaffSearch()`
- ‚úÖ `ADMINISTRATION` ‚Üí Checks for `isHiringActivity` flag, calls `completeHiringProcess()` or `completeBookkeeping()`

---

### 3. UI Components

#### StaffSearchOptionsModal (`StaffSearchOptionsModal.tsx`)
**Location**: `src/components/ui/modals/UImodals/StaffSearchOptionsModal.tsx`

**Features**:
- Number of candidates dropdown (1, 3, 5, 10)
- Skill level slider (0.1 - 1.0) with dynamic skill names
- **Specialization checkboxes** (field, winery, administration, sales, maintenance)
- Real-time cost calculation display
- Two work calculation tables:
  1. Search process estimate
  2. Hiring process estimate (min-max range)
- Submit button showing total cost

#### StaffSearchResultsModal (`StaffSearchResultsModal.tsx`)
**Location**: `src/components/ui/modals/UImodals/StaffSearchResultsModal.tsx`

**Features**:
- Displays all generated candidates
- For each candidate shows:
  - Name, nationality (with flag emoji), skill level badge
  - Specialization badges (with proper titles)
  - Skill bars (visual representation)
  - Monthly wage
  - Individual "Hire" button
- Allows hiring multiple candidates from one search
- Auto-opens when search completes
- Persists until closed or new search started

#### Updated Staff Page (`Staff.tsx`)
**Location**: `src/components/pages/Staff.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Replaced "Hire Staff" with "Search for Staff" button
- Auto-opens results modal when search completes
- Polls game state for pending candidates (1s interval)
- Fixed specialization display to show titles instead of keys
- Integrated both new modals

---

- Proper styling and interaction

---

### 5. Type System Updates

#### GameState Extension
**Location**: `src/lib/types/types.ts`

**Added**:
```typescript
pendingStaffCandidates?: {
  activityId: string;
  candidates: Staff[];
  searchOptions: StaffSearchOptions;
  timestamp: number;
};
```

#### Transaction Categories
**Location**: `src/lib/constants/financeConstants.ts`

**Added**: `STAFF_SEARCH` category for search cost transactions

---

### 6. Export Updates
**Location**: `src/lib/services/index.ts`

**Added Exports**:
- All staff search service functions

## üí∞ Cost & Money Flow

### Search Cost
- **When**: Deducted when search activity STARTS
- **Amount**: Based on formula from v3
  - Base cost: ‚Ç¨2,000
  - Candidate scaling: `candidates^1.5`
  - Skill scaling: `skillMultiplier^1.8`
  - Specialization scaling: `2^specializations.length`
- **Transaction**: "Staff search for N candidates (Skill level)"

### Hiring Cost
- **When**: Deducted when hiring activity COMPLETES
- **Amount**: First month's wage of the candidate
- **Transaction**: "Hired [Name] - First month's wage"

### Ongoing Wages
- **When**: Season start (week 1)
- **Amount**: 12 weeks √ó weekly wage (per season)
- **Handled by**: Existing `processSeasonalWages()` function

## üéØ Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Candidate Storage** | GameState + temporary | Persists during session, cleared on new search |
| **Search Cost Timing** | Activity start | Upfront investment matches v3 |
| **Multiple Hires** | Yes | Flexibility - each creates separate hiring activity |
| **Unhired Candidates** | Cleared on close/new search | Clean state management |
| **Specialization Display** | Map to titles | Better UX than showing keys |
| **Auto-open Results** | Yes | Immediate feedback when search completes |

---

## üìä Specialization System

### Backend (Fully Functional)
- ‚úÖ Skill generation with bonuses (20-40% higher in specialized area)
- ‚úÖ Wage calculation with bonuses (30% per specialization, multiplicative)
- ‚úÖ Stored in database (`specializations` array field)

### Frontend (Now Integrated)
- ‚úÖ Checkbox selection in search modal
- ‚úÖ Badge display in results modal
- ‚úÖ Badge display in staff list
- ‚úÖ Maps keys to human-readable titles (field ‚Üí "Vineyard Manager")
