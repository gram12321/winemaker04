# Wine Features Framework - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - Framework + Oxidation

Generic framework for wine faults (oxidation, green flavor) and positive features (terroir). Config-driven architecture - add new features with just configuration, no code changes needed.

### **What We Built:**
- Generic risk accumulation (time-based + event-triggered)
- Quality/price effects (power function, customer sensitivity)
- Prestige events (unified 'wine_feature' type)
- UI components (badges, risk display, detailed tooltips)
- Oxidation fully implemented as first feature

### **What's Next:**
- **Phase 2:** Green Flavor (event-triggered fault)
- **Phase 3:** Terroir Expression (graduated positive feature)
- **Phase 4:** Additional features (cork taint, brett, etc.)

## 📋 **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Core Type System** ✅
**Created:** `src/lib/types/wineFeatures.ts`
- `WineFeature` interface - represents a single feature on a wine batch
- `FeatureConfig` interface - complete configuration for any feature
- Support for binary and graduated manifestation
- Support for time-based and event-triggered accumulation
- Quality effect types: power, linear, custom, bonus
- Customer sensitivity and prestige impact configuration

### **2. Feature Configuration** ✅
**Created:** `src/lib/constants/wineFeatures/`
- `oxidation.ts` - Complete oxidation feature config
- `index.ts` - Feature registry and helper functions
- Migrated all oxidation parameters to config:
  - Base rate: 2% per week
  - State multipliers (grapes: 3.0x, bottled: 0.3x)
  - Compound effect enabled
  - Quality: power function (exponent 1.5, base penalty 25%)
  - Customer sensitivity (Collectors: 60%, Restaurants: 85%)
  - Prestige: Company -0.5 (20yr decay), Vineyard -2.0 (3yr decay)

### **3. Feature Risk Service** ✅
**Created:** `src/lib/services/wine/featureRiskService.ts`
- `processWeeklyFeatureRisks()` - Handles all time-based features
- `processEventTrigger()` - Handles event-triggered features
- `initializeBatchFeatures()` - Creates features array for new batches
- Automatic manifestation checks and notifications
- Prestige event triggers on manifestation
- Risk warning system with thresholds

### **4. Feature Effects Service** ✅
**Created:** `src/lib/services/wine/featureEffectsService.ts`
- `calculateEffectiveQuality()` - Applies all feature quality effects
- `calculateFeaturePriceMultiplier()` - Applies customer sensitivity
- `getPresentFeaturesSorted()` - UI helper for displaying features
- `hasAnyFaults()` - Quick fault check
- `getFeature()` / `hasFeature()` - Feature lookup helpers

### **5. Feature Prestige Service** ✅
**Created:** `src/lib/services/prestige/featurePrestigeService.ts`
- `addFeaturePrestigeEvent()` - Generic prestige event handler
- Supports onManifestation and onSale events
- Separate company and vineyard impacts
- Backwards compatible with existing prestige system

### **6. Database Integration** ✅
**Modified:** `src/lib/database/activities/inventoryDB.ts`

- Clean implementation (no legacy fields)

**Database Migration:** Use MCP Supabase tools to add `features` JSONB column

### **7. Game Tick Integration** ✅
**Modified:** `src/lib/services/core/gameTick.ts`
- Replaced `processWeeklyOxidation()` with `processWeeklyFeatureRisks()`
- Processes all time-based features every game tick

### **8. Wine Pricing Integration** ✅
**Modified:** `src/lib/services/wine/wineScoreCalculation.ts`
- Uses `calculateEffectiveQuality()` instead of raw quality
- Automatically applies all feature quality effects
- Price calculation now reflects feature penalties/bonuses

### **9. Order Generation Integration** ✅
**Modified:** `src/lib/services/sales/generateOrder.ts`
- Applies `calculateFeaturePriceMultiplier()` to bid price
- Customer sensitivity to features affects offers
- Collectors offer 60% for oxidized wine, chain stores 90%

### **10. Sales Integration** ✅
**Modified:** `src/lib/services/sales/salesService.ts`
- Triggers onSale prestige events when selling wine with faults
- Integrated with existing fulfillment flow
- Company prestige hit when selling oxidized wine

### **11. UI Components** ✅
**Created:** `src/components/ui/wine/FeatureBadge.tsx`
- Generic `FeatureBadge` component for individual features
- `FeatureBadges` component for displaying all features
- Sorts by priority (faults first)
- Shows severity for graduated features

## 🎮 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Feature Lifecycle:**

1. **Initialization (Harvest):**
   ```typescript
   batch.features = initializeBatchFeatures()
   // Creates feature instances for all active features
   // Oxidation starts with risk: 0, isPresent: false
   ```

2. **Risk Accumulation (Weekly):**
   ```typescript
   processWeeklyFeatureRisks()
   // For each batch, for each time-based feature:
   // - Calculate risk increase (baseRate × multipliers)
   // - Roll for manifestation (Math.random() < risk)
   // - If manifests: isPresent = true, severity = 1.0 (binary)
   // - Send notifications, trigger prestige events
   ```

3. **Effects Application (Always):**
   ```typescript
   effectiveQuality = calculateEffectiveQuality(batch)
   // Applies all feature quality effects
   // Oxidation: quality × (1 - scaledPenalty) × grapeSeverity
   
   priceMultiplier = calculateFeaturePriceMultiplier(batch, customerType)
   // Applies customer sensitivity
   // Collectors: 0.60 for oxidized, Restaurants: 0.85
   ```

4. **Sale Events:**
   ```typescript
   fulfillWineOrder(orderId)
   // When selling wine with faults:
   // - Triggers onSale prestige events
   // - Company prestige -0.5 (20 year decay)
   // - Permanent reputation damage
   ```

## 🔑 **KEY DESIGN FEATURES**

### **Config-Driven**
Add new features by creating config - no code changes needed!

```typescript
// Future: Add green flavor with just this config
export const GREEN_FLAVOR_FEATURE: FeatureConfig = {
  id: 'green_flavor',
  // ... configuration only
};
```

### **Binary + Graduated Support**
```typescript
// Binary (Oxidation): 0% → 100% instant
manifestation: 'binary'

// Graduated (Future Terroir): 15% → 100% over time
manifestation: 'graduated'
severityGrowth: { rate: 0.02, cap: 1.0 }
```

### **Time-Based + Event-Triggered**
```typescript
// Time-based (Oxidation): Accumulates weekly
trigger: 'time_based'
baseRate: 0.02

// Event-triggered (Future Green Flavor): Only on crushing
trigger: 'event_triggered'
eventTriggers: [{ event: 'crushing', condition: ..., riskIncrease: 0.25 }]
```

### **Positive Features**
```typescript
// Future: Terroir expression gives quality BONUS
type: 'feature'  // Not 'fault'
quality: { type: 'bonus', amount: +0.15 }
customerSensitivity: { 'Private Collector': 1.25 }  // 25% PREMIUM!
```

## 🔧 **DATABASE MIGRATION**

**Required:** Use MCP Supabase tools to add features column:

```typescript
// Execute with mcp_supabase_apply_migration
ALTER TABLE wine_batches 
ADD COLUMN features JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;

CREATE INDEX idx_wine_batches_features ON wine_batches USING GIN (features);

// Drop legacy oxidation columns
ALTER TABLE wine_batches 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS oxidation,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_oxidized;
```

**Note:** Database will be reset during development. No backwards compatibility needed.

## 🎨 **EXAMPLE: Adding New Feature**

```typescript
// To add cork taint feature, just create config:
export const CORK_TAINT_FEATURE: FeatureConfig = {
  id: 'cork_taint',
  name: 'Cork Taint',
  type: 'fault',
  manifestation: 'binary',
  riskAccumulation: {
    trigger: 'event_triggered',
    eventTriggers: [{
      event: 'bottling',
      condition: (options) => options.closureType === 'natural_cork',
      riskIncrease: 0.02  // 2% chance per bottling
    }]
  },
  effects: {
    quality: { type: 'linear', amount: -0.30 },  // 30% penalty
    // ... rest of config
  }
  // ...
};

// Add to ACTIVE_FEATURES array in index.ts - DONE!
```

No code changes needed - framework handles everything!
