Great everything seems to work. Lets update our docs. 
 @docs/versionlog.md
 @readme.md
 @.cursor/rules/ai-agent.rule.mdc/airulesVS.instructions.md and  @.cursor/rules/airules.mdc These two should be identical 

## Rules vs readme.
Try to keep rules clean of additional info, just AI rules. 
Try not to dublicate info betwenn rules and readme

## AI INFO FOR VERSIONLOG UPDATE
Version numbers should follow the Git commit names. 
IE Gitcommit 9db1324f69a9358fab5fd59128806e4299cf5e1f : name is 0.0023a This is the version number. Followed by commit titel [Fix missing M3 games ...]

Use yor git MCP tools to check git commit. 
- Create a entry for each in the version log. 
- 3-5 lines depending on extend of updates. 
- Focus on changed files, added/removed functions/functionality. 
- Do not focus on bug fixed, and stuff that was not used in the end anyway.
